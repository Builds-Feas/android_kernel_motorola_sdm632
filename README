# âš  Deprecation notice
In addition to 4.9 branch of the Linux kernel being waaay past its end-of-life, KernelSU dropped support for non-GKI kernels in v0.9.5 and nobody on the Builds-Feas team has Motorola devices with SDM632 for further testing this kernel, therefore 4.9.337-R5 is the final release and this kernel is no longer supported. We strongly recommend moving on to a new device, preferably with GKI support.
Thanks for your support, if you find this somehow useful, you can freely exercise your GPLv2 (and other compatible licenses by contributors) rights by forking this repo. Please keep in mind that PRs to this repo are going to be ignored.
